                                    A garage full of power tools won’t build your house for you but they can greatly increase the speed and efficiency of doing
                                    so if you choose to use them. The same is true for the tools and knowledge available
                                    to you through Self Made Man. Instead of offering a "warranty" as insurance for a potential

                                    philosophy. We know our product has value. We know that if you implement it, you’ll see
                                    results and so we challenge you to do so. Success is equal parts dedication and commitment
                                    so if you can put any system from a purchased masterclass to use fully within 6 months
                                    of enrolling, we’ll give you a full refund as a reward for your focused pursuit of improvement.
                                    As we offer a masterclass that is valuable to you, we recognize that a motivated and
                                    successful student is valuable to us.
